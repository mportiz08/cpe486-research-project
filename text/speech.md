## introduction

One of the most essential components of an effective **natural user interface** is **speech recognition** (also commonly referred to as voice recognition). In simple terms, **speech recognition** reflects the interaction between a person and some sort of computing device or system that involves the person using his/her voice to provide input to the system.

Here is how the British-English dictionary [defines](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/voice-recognition) the term **voice recognition**:

> the ability of a computer to know the voice of a person speaking into it, so that only voices that the computer knows can use the system

Let's look at a simple example of how this technology is being used by popular modern applications:

Siri (Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is an application developed by Apple for the most recent version of their incredibly popular product, the iPhone. In this example of its use, a user simply asks their question to their phone with this application running on their phone, and the software responds by presenting the user with a list of appropriate restaurants along with reviews and maps for each one. Siri exemplifies the pinnacle of how **speech recognition** technology is being used in consumer products today.
