        <h2>introduction</h2>

        <p>One of the most essential components of an effective <strong>natural user interface</strong> is <strong>speech recognition</strong> (also commonly referred to as voice recognition). In simple terms, <strong>speech recognition</strong> reflects the interaction between a person and some sort of computing device or system that involves the person using his/her voice to provide input to the system.</p>

        <p>Here is how the British-English dictionary <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/voice-recognition">defines</a> the term <strong>voice recognition</strong>:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>the ability of a computer to know the voice of a person speaking into it, so that only voices that the computer knows can use the system</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Let&#39;s look at a simple example of how this technology is being used by popular modern applications:</p>

        <p><img src="http://images.apple.com/iphone/features/images/siri_mean.jpg" alt="Siri"></p>

        <p>Siri (Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is an application developed by Apple for the most recent version of their incredibly popular product, the iPhone. In this example of its use, a user simply asks their question to their phone with this application running on their phone, and the software responds by presenting the user with a list of appropriate restaurants along with reviews and maps for each one. Siri exemplifies the pinnacle of how <strong>speech recognition</strong> technology is being used in consumer products today.</p>
