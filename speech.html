        <h2>introduction</h2>

        <p>One of the most essential components of an effective <strong>natural user interface</strong> is <strong>speech recognition</strong> (also commonly referred to as voice recognition). In simple terms, <strong>speech recognition</strong> reflects the interaction between a person and some sort of computing device or system that involves the person using his/her voice to provide input to the system.</p>

        <p>Here is how the British-English dictionary <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/voice-recognition">defines</a> the term <strong>voice recognition</strong>:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>the ability of a computer to know the voice of a person speaking into it, so that only voices that the computer knows can use the system</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Let&#39;s look at a simple example of how this technology is being used by popular modern applications:</p>

        <p><img src="http://images.apple.com/iphone/features/images/siri_mean.jpg" alt="Siri"></p>

        <p>Siri (Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is an application developed by Apple for the most recent version of their incredibly popular product, the iPhone. In this example of its use, a user simply asks their question to their phone with this application running on their phone, and the software responds by presenting the user with a list of appropriate restaurants along with reviews and maps for each one. Siri exemplifies the pinnacle of how <strong>speech recognition</strong> technology is being used in consumer products today.</p>

        <h2>kinect</h2>

        <h3>technical aspects</h3>

        <p>In addition to color, depth, and skeletal data, Microsoft&#39;s <a href="http://www.xbox.com/kinect/">Kinect</a> collects sound data, which allows the device to respond to voice commands. According to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2009/sep09/09-23tgsnatalpr.aspx">Microsoft&#39;s press release</a>, the Kinect (originally introduced as Project Natal) is equipped with a &quot;multi-array microphone&quot;, which handles processing the voice commands. The folks at <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit</a> <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft-Kinect-Teardown/4066/">disassembled</a> the sensor and discovered that it contains 4 downward facing microphones that the array is composed of.</p>

        <p><img src="http://guide-images.ifixit.net/igi/VNIBCIuTyLIAUXqT.medium" alt="kinect microphone internals"></p>

        <p>The audio capabilities of the Kinect are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>acoustic noise suppression</li>
        <li>echo cancellation</li>
        <li>beam formation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here&#39;s a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/kinect/voice/speech-recognition#d7e21da22ba34426bf8f46afc9028e79">link</a> to a listing of languages that the Kinect&#39;s speech recognition software currently recognizes and supports.</p>

        <p>To be used effectively, the device needs to be calibrated, so that it can better recognize voice commands. Also, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/">Kinect SDK</a> gives third party developers access to these audio features.</p>

        <h3>dashboard integration</h3>

        <p>Microsoft <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/kinect/voice/speech-recognition">utilizes</a> the speech recognition capabilities of the Kinect by allowing Xbox 360 users to control their gaming consoles with their voice. On the main dashboard interface for the 360, a microphone icon is visible whenever users are able to use voice commands. If visible, users start by saying &quot;Xbox&quot; and then follow that with one of many different options that appear on the screen in a way that is context sensitive depending on the section of the dashboard that is being used. For example:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Xbox&quot;<br />
        &quot;...play disc.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Without any physical contact from the user, the Xbox will then load the software on the current disc.</p>
